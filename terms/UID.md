#### Definition

A *UID* is a *unique identifier*: a string of characters which distinguishes an item or record from every other record in a system or network. 

#### Notes

UIDs are optional now, but are ultimately important for scalable media network growth, searchability and interoperability.  

UIDs do not need to be manually generated or entered; instead; they can be generated by combining data from other variables.  For example, in a *Media Assets* table, the UID can be autogenerated by combining other traits.
