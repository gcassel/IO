#### Definition

*A service* is *an [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) or [event](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md)* which is *meant to be useful* in a well-[defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Note that while *[access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to a service* (such as a ticket or coupon) may be treated as a [transferable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transfer.md) [good](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/good.md), the service itself-- which is time-limited, and socially specialized-- is never transferable.
