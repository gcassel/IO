#### Definition

*Accessible* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of any [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which is:

1. [predictably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) [available](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/availability.md)
1. reasonably easy for a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to find
2. [affordable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/afford.md) for that type of agent to *start [using](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)*, or *[learning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/learn.md) to use*, [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effect.md)

#### Notes
As *accessibility* is strictly determined by relationships between resources and agents, it's a [relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md).  (However, as all traits are *ultimately* relational, the future of "relational trait" in these ontologies is questionable.)
