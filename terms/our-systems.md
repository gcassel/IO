#### Definition

*Our systems* means *all communications systems, platforms, channels, spaces, locations, meetings, events and activities* which are *directly governed by our project or by our representatives*.\


#### Notes
[Our channels](https://github.com/gcassel/IOT/blob/main/terms/our-channels.md) is a more basic and important term than *our channels* in the modular development of networks with channel-based governance, because systems often interoperate across multiple projects.
