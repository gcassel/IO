#### Definition
A resource is any *force or form* which *can support one or more goals* and *is not an agent*. 

#### Notes
This intentionally expansive definition is meant to be used in well-defined contexts.

Resources may be mental, physical or media.  Resources are often considered to be *assets* within reasonably well-defined contexts, especially [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/IO/blob/main/terms/project.md).
