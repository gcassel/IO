An issue is an item or set which represents perceived costs, benefits, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and/or risks in relation to a specific [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) or [project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md).  Issues can be valuable sources of constructive change; therefore, they are often identified without (or, before) making changes, suggestions or proposals.
