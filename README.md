# IOD / Inclusive Organizing Definitions
This repository is for developing the ontology and practical technical definitions used in [Inclusive Organizing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit?usp=sharing) (IO) and compatible systems.  

Most of these definitions will be based on [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology) definitions, but will be precisely tailored to support IO-based systems.  This repository is unlikely to get nearly as extensive or self-referential as MOT, because IO definitions need to be practically strict, lean and stable.
