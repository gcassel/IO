# IO
This repository is for developing the ontology and practical technical definitions of [Inclusive Organizing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit?usp=sharing) (IO) modules.  Most of these definitions will be based on [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology) definitions, but will be precisely tailored to support IO-based systems.
