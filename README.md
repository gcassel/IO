# IO / Inclusive Organizing Definitions
This repository is for developing practical technical definitions used in [Inclusive Organizing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit?usp=sharing) (IO) and compatible systems.  

Most of these IO entries will be based on [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology) definitions, but precisely tailored to support the principles and practices of IO-based systems.  (Note that IO-based systems may also use some of the MOT definitions, when those are sufficiently precise for the contexts they're used in.)

This IO repository is unlikely to get nearly as extensive or self-referential as MOT, because IO definitions need to be practically strict, lean and stable.
